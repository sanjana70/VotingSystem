# About This Project
This project was developed to create a voting system using blockchain concepts, for the VOC course.

### Process of the system:
First the user must start the voting process.
Next the voting process commences and votes can be cast.
Once voting is completed the user can end voting.
The total votes can only be viewed after the voting process is entirely completed.
Then the total votes and total voters can be viewed as the output.

Note: The proposal descisions are decided using smart contract in this system.
